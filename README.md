### Installation
If you do not have a file called autoexec.cfg, make a new file called autoexec.cfg and place it into your TF2 directory. See below for information on how to do this.

### Toggle Key
Replace the key in `bind KEY` with whatever key you would like to turn on and off the chat.

### Creating autoexec.cfg: (only if you do not have autoexec.cfg in your TF2 Directory)
1. Open Notepad
2. File > Save As...
3. Under `File Name` type in `autoexec.cfg`
4. Below it there is `Save as Type` and it should say `Text Documents (*.txt)`. Click it and choose `All Files` and save it into your TF2 directory.
